## Calibration Data

Derived from 7 real Models Agent reference conversations (XML format, `experiments/reference-conversations/`).

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `systemPromptSize` | ~10,000 tokens | Range 9,425–10,848 across sessions |
| `toolCallSize` | ~75 tokens avg | Mean 73, range 16–1,598 (most calls are compact) |
| `toolResultSize` | ~380 tokens avg | Mean 380, range 5–6,804 (high variance) |
| `assistantMessageSize` | ~130 tokens avg | Mean 128, range 7–2,986 |
| `userMessageSize` | ~60 tokens avg | Mean 56, range 2–470 |
| `userMessageFrequency` | ~12 tool calls/user turn | Mean 11.5 across sessions |

**Canonical calibrated config** (used as baseline from Exp 003 onward):
```json
{
  "toolCallCycles": 200,
  "toolCallSize": 75,
  "toolResultSize": 380,
  "assistantMessageSize": 130,
  "userMessageFrequency": 12,
  "userMessageSize": 60,
  "systemPromptSize": 10000
}
```

Token estimation methodology: 1 token ≈ 4 characters (from calibration script).

## Strategy Baselines (Exp 003 — Calibrated, 200 cycles)

Canonical reference costs at calibrated Models Agent parameters (200 tool-call cycles).

| Strategy | Total Cost | vs lcm-subagent | Compactions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lcm-subagent` | $10.49 | — | several |
| `lossless-hierarchical` | $11.34 | +8% | several |
| `incremental` | $11.43 | +9% | several |
| `lossless-tool-results` | $11.63 | +11% | several |
| `lossless-append` | $11.92 | +14% | several |
| `full-compaction` | $20.71 | +97% | several |

**lcm-subagent is the cheapest strategy** at the calibrated baseline for 200-cycle (long) sessions. full-compaction is nearly 2× more expensive and should be avoided for long sessions.

---

## Strategy Baselines (Exp 005 — Calibrated, 80 cycles / Short Session)

At 80 tool-call cycles, most strategies do NOT trigger compaction (context stays below 85% threshold).

| Strategy | Total Cost | Peak Context | Compactions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `incremental` | $4.03 | 43,011 tokens | 2 |
| `lossless-tool-results` | $4.05 | 43,011 tokens | 2 |
| `lcm-subagent` | $4.05 | 43,011 tokens | 2 |
| `lossless-hierarchical` | $4.12 | 43,011 tokens | 2 |
| `lossless-append` | $4.15 | 43,011 tokens | 2 |
| `full-compaction` | $6.03 | 97,220 tokens | **0** |

**Key insight**: At 80 cycles, full-compaction never fires — it ends up with a 97k-token context and costs 50% more than competitors despite no compaction work. All other strategies behave nearly identically (cost spread < $0.12).

**Crossover observed**: incremental < lcm-subagent at 80 cycles, but lcm-subagent < incremental at 200 cycles. Crossover point is somewhere between 80–200 cycles (Exp 007 will characterise this).

## Tool Result Size Sensitivity (Exp 004)

Sweep over toolResultSize 100–5,000 tokens (log scale, 5 steps), all strategies at 200 cycles.

| toolResultSize | lcm-subagent | lossless-hier | incremental | lossless-tool | lossless-app | full-compact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | $9.95 | $10.50 | $10.43 | $10.48 | $10.84 | $22.08 |
| 266 | $10.25 | $11.02 | $10.99 | $11.15 | $11.45 | $20.77 |
| 380 (baseline) | $10.49 | $11.34 | $11.43 | $11.63 | $11.92 | $20.71 |
| 707 | $11.10 | $12.50 | $12.57 | $12.94 | $13.17 | $22.70 |
| 1,880 | $12.81 | $15.45 | $16.49 | $17.12 | $17.15 | $24.86 |
| 5,000 | $16.99 | $22.71 | $20.41 | $21.11 | $21.12 | $30.35 |

**Key findings:**
1. **lcm-subagent dominates at all tool result sizes** (100–5,000 tokens).
2. At small results (≤266 tokens): ranking among mid-tier strategies shuffles slightly, but differences are small.
3. At large results (≥1,880 tokens): lossless-hierarchical becomes *more* expensive than incremental — hierarchical storage of large tool results becomes costly.
4. At very large results (5,000 tokens): lcm-subagent saves $3.4 over the next cheapest (incremental).
5. lcm-subagent advantage grows with tool result size.

**Models Agent tool result size** averages 380 tokens (well within the range where lcm-subagent wins clearly).

## Compression Ratio Sensitivity (Exp 006)

Sweep over `compressionRatio` [3, 5, 10, 15, 20] for `incremental` and `lcm-subagent` at the calibrated baseline (200 cycles).

| compressionRatio | incremental | lcm-subagent | difference | lcm_advantage% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | $14.30 | $13.04 | $1.26 | 8.83% |
| 5 | $13.50 | $11.44 | **$2.06** | **15.23%** |
| 10 (baseline) | $11.43 | $10.49 | $0.94 | 8.20% |
| 15 | $10.74 | $10.21 | $0.52 | 4.88% |
| 20 | $10.39 | $10.08 | $0.31 | 3.00% |

Compaction events: 7 for both strategies at every ratio — ratio does not affect compaction frequency.

**Key findings:**
1. **lcm-subagent dominates at all compression ratios** — ranking is stable across the full range.
2. **Peak lcm-subagent advantage at ratio=5 (15.23%)**, not at extreme ratios.
3. **"Higher compression always cheaper" is a modelling artefact** — the model has no quality penalty for information loss. The default ratio=10 is a defensible practical choice.

## lcm-subagent vs Incremental Crossover (Exp 007)

Sweep over `toolCallCycles` [80–200] for `incremental` and `lcm-subagent`, calibrated baseline.

| toolCallCycles | incremental | lcm-subagent | cheaper | gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | $4.031 | $4.053 | incremental | $0.022 |
| 100 | $5.120 | $5.092 | **lcm-subagent** | $0.028 |
| 120 | $6.302 | $6.173 | lcm-subagent | $0.129 |
| 140 | $7.602 | $7.348 | lcm-subagent | $0.253 |
| 160 | $8.766 | $8.347 | lcm-subagent | $0.419 |
| 180 | $10.048 | $9.400 | lcm-subagent | $0.648 |
| 200 | $11.428 | $10.491 | lcm-subagent | $0.937 |

**Crossover at ~89 cycles** (between 80 and 100). lcm-subagent advantage widens monotonically past the crossover (~$0.045 per 10 additional cycles).

**Updated recommendation: use lcm-subagent unconditionally** for all Models Agent sessions. The penalty at short sessions ($0.022 at 80 cycles) is negligible; the benefit at 200 cycles is $0.94.

---

## incrementalInterval Sensitivity (Exp 008)

Sweep over `incrementalInterval` [15k, 30k, 50k, 80k] × `toolCallCycles` [80, 150, 200] for `incremental` and `lcm-subagent`.

| cycles | interval | incremental | lcm-subagent | cheaper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | 15,000 | $3.542 | $3.456 | lcm-subagent |
| 80 | 30,000 | $4.031 | $4.053 | incremental |
| 80 | 50,000 | $4.583 | $4.659 | incremental |
| 80 | 80,000 | $5.692 | $5.692 | tie |
| 150 | 15,000 | $7.198 | $6.602 | lcm-subagent |
| 150 | 80,000 | $11.510 | $11.649 | incremental |
| 200 | 15,000 | $10.147 | $8.837 | lcm-subagent |
| 200 | 30,000 | $11.428 | $10.491 | lcm-subagent |
| 200 | 80,000 | $15.390 | $15.300 | lcm-subagent |

**Key findings:**
1. **Model always prefers interval=15k** — a modelling artefact (cheap compaction, no quality penalty). Do not treat as a production recommendation.
2. **30k (default) is the defensible practical choice** — avoids over-summarisation risks, 2–7 compactions per session.
3. **At 80k interval, strategies converge** — with only 1–2 compactions both strategies behave nearly identically.
4. Confirms Exp 007 crossover: incremental wins at 80 cycles with 30k+ intervals; lcm-subagent wins at 15k even for short sessions.

**Engine change (Exp 008):** Added `NumericValuesRange` to `sweep-types.ts` and handler in `sweep.ts` so numeric sweep params support `"values": [...]` arrays in addition to `{min, max, steps, scale}` ranges.

## pRetrieveMax Sensitivity (Exp 009)

Sweep over `pRetrieveMax` [0.0–1.0] × `toolCallCycles` [100, 150, 200] for `lcm-subagent` and `incremental`, calibrated baseline.

### Crossover thresholds

| toolCallCycles | pRetrieveMax where incremental wins | lcm advantage at default (0.2) |
|---|---|---|
| 100 | ~0.27 | +0.5% (negligible) |
| 150 | ~0.47 | +4.2% |
| 200 | ~0.77 | +8.2% |

**Key findings:**
1. **At pRetrieveMax=0, lcm-subagent still wins** (+3–11% by session length). The advantage is structural — full-replacement compaction produces a more cache-stable context prefix. Retrieval pricing is secondary.
2. **Default pRetrieveMax=0.2 is conservatively positioned.** The store fills gradually, so average p(retrieve) during a session is ~0.05–0.10. The recommendation is robust.
3. **Crossover threshold scales with session length.** Longer sessions → more compactions → more cache savings → more budget to absorb retrieval overhead.
4. **At 100-cycle sessions, the margin is thin** (0.5%). The recommendation holds but is nearly indifferent at this length.
5. **At ≥150 cycles, the recommendation is robust** — crossover at 0.47–0.77, far above operational range.

## compressedTokensCap Sensitivity (Exp 010)

Sweep over `compressedTokensCap` [20k–500k] × `toolCallCycles` [100, 150, 200] for `lcm-subagent` and `incremental`, pRetrieveMax=0.2 (default).

| cap | lcm(100) | adv(100) | lcm(150) | adv(150) | lcm(200) | adv(200) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20,000 | $5.175 | -1.1% LOSE | $7.870 | +3.2% | $10.575 | +7.5% |
| 50,000 | $5.148 | -0.5% LOSE | $7.842 | +3.5% | $10.547 | +7.7% |
| 100,000 (default) | $5.092 | **+0.5%** | $7.786 | +4.2% | $10.491 | +8.2% |
| 200,000 | $5.002 | +2.3% | $7.647 | +5.9% | $10.346 | +9.5% |
| 500,000 | $4.988 | +2.6% | $7.592 | +6.6% | $10.227 | +10.5% |

Incremental cost is constant (cap-insensitive by design).

**Key findings:**
1. **Effect is modest**: 25× cap range → only ~3.4% lcm-subagent cost swing. Cap is a secondary lever vs pRetrieveMax.
2. **Mechanism**: larger cap → retrieval probability ramps more slowly as store fills → lower average retrieval cost → larger lcm advantage.
3. **Default cap=100k sits at the crossover for 100-cycle sessions** (+0.5%). At cap<100k, lcm marginally loses at 100 cycles.
4. **At ≥150 cycles, recommendation is cap-insensitive** — lcm wins even at cap=20k (+3.2% at 150 cycles).

## Cross-Experiment Conclusions

### Strategy recommendation for Models Agent

**Use `lcm-subagent` unconditionally.** Across 10 experiments spanning Phase 1 (baselines and parameter sweeps) and Phase 2 (retrieval stress tests), lcm-subagent is the cheapest strategy in every realistic scenario.

| Session length | Strategy | Cost advantage over next-best | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≥150 cycles | `lcm-subagent` | 4–11% over incremental | High — robust to all tested perturbations |
| 90–150 cycles | `lcm-subagent` | 0.5–4% over incremental | Medium — thin but consistent advantage |
| <90 cycles | `lcm-subagent` (or any except full-compaction) | Negligible | Low — nearly indifferent at this length |
| Any length | Avoid `full-compaction` | 50–100% more expensive | Very high |

**Why lcm-subagent wins** (Exp 009 insight): The advantage is structural — full-replacement compaction produces a more cache-stable context prefix. This drives cache reuse savings that persist even with retrieval disabled. Retrieval pricing amplifies but does not create the advantage.

### Implementation parameters for Models Agent

| Parameter | Recommended value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `selectedStrategy` | `lcm-subagent` | Use unconditionally |
| `compressionRatio` | 10 (default) | Higher appears cheaper in model but is a modelling artefact; 10× is practically achievable |
| `incrementalInterval` | 30,000 (default) | 15k appears cheapest but is a modelling artefact; 30k avoids over-summarisation risk |
| `pRetrieveMax` | 0.2 (default) | Well within safe zone; recommendation flips only at 0.27–0.77 depending on session length |
| `compressedTokensCap` | 100,000 (default) | Secondary lever; 25× variation → 3.4% cost swing; default well-positioned |

### Modelling limitations (do not over-interpret)

1. **Compression ratio**: No quality penalty for over-compression — model always prefers higher ratios. Real-world compression quality degrades before 10×.
2. **Compaction frequency**: No latency or quality-degradation cost for over-compaction — model always prefers shorter intervals. Real compaction has latency overhead.
3. **Retrieval quality**: `pRetrieveMax` is fixed and doesn't degrade with store size. Exp 009 showed the recommendation remains robust unless average retrieval rates are implausibly high (>30–80% of steps).
4. **Conversation determinism**: Simulated conversations are deterministic averages. Real conversations have higher variance in tool result sizes and cycle counts.

### Open questions for future investigation

- **Latency modelling**: When wall-clock time matters, compaction frequency trade-offs may flip. Would require engine changes.
- **Crossover shift under combined conditions**: The ~89-cycle crossover may shift under elevated pRetrieveMax + small cap + high compression simultaneously.
- **Retrieval degradation model**: A more realistic model where pRetrieve degrades with store age/size would stress-test the recommendation further.
